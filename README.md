# Learn-React-In-A-Day
This is an experiment where I try to learn react and react hooks in a day.

What I built :
1. A Contact Card App.
2. A ToDo List
3. A Form (React based)

This was build to learn the following :
```
JSX
Props and state
Conditional rendering
Functional components
Class components
Styling components
Lifecycle methods
Fetching data from APIs
Handling events
Forms in React
Controlled components
Writing modern React
Local dev setup
React Hooks
```
